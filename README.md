DESCRIPTION:
Web framework is Flask.
Contains elements of CSS, HTML, Python, JavaScript.

This is a website whose purpose is for potential space travellers & planet colonisers to enter their details regarding their work record, location, contact information, salary data and area of expertise. Then an algorithm is used to determine their likelihood of usefulness for space exploration and colonisation of the planet Gleise 12b. You can navigate the main page using the links in the top left, and learn about the planet, and also use the sign up buttons to register on the database.

There is backend code that can be run manually to determine the persons suitability, as well as a 'random person generator' which will automatically fill out the details of the signee into the database, for automatic data handling later.

There is also an admin login page, which can then be used to add and remove users, as well as to view the individual details of those who have signed up and their information.
